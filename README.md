# Burger Town

Burger Town enables anyone to add a burger and corresponding restaurant they would like to eat. Data is stored in a MySQL database.

## Objective

The purpose of this project was to build a homemade ORM and structure the app using the MVC pattern. I also explored the Bulma CSS framework, which I found quite nice to work with!

## Uses:

* Node JS
* MySQL
* Express
* Handlebars
* Bulma
